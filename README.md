# Camera App

**Question 3:** Create a flutter app that uses the device camera and takes the picture and displays the image on the screen. 

## Description

The app uses <code>image_picker</code> package to use the device camera to take a picture. There is also an option of choosing a picture from your gallery. <code>flutter riverpod</code> was used for state management. <br>
